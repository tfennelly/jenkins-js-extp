Jenkins UI client-side Extension Point API. 

__WARNING__: The types defined in this package are very likely to change as we learn more
about how best to create client-side extension points. If you use these types, be aware that
they are very likely to change i.e. use at your own risk.

The hope is that this may eventually be formalised and  move to an NPM package of its own.
